# **JavaScript Exercises – Comparisons, Truthy & Falsy, and Control Structures**  

## **What’s This About?**  
This set of exercises will help you get comfortable with some essential JavaScript concepts. You’ll learn how to compare values, understand what makes something "truthy" or "falsy," and use `if` statements to control your code. By the end, you’ll even make a webpage respond to user actions!  

### **1. Understanding Comparisons**  
Comparisons help us make decisions in code. JavaScript gives us different ways to check if things are equal or how they relate to each other:  

- **Equality operators:** `==` (loose equality) vs. `===` (strict equality)  
- **Inequality operators:** `!=` (loose inequality) vs. `!==` (strict inequality)  
- **Relational operators:** `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`  

Understanding these will help you write better conditions and avoid tricky mistakes.  

### **2. Truthy and Falsy Values**  
Some values in JavaScript are considered **"truthy"** (they act like `true`), while others are **"falsy"** (they act like `false`).  

- **Falsy values:** `0`, `""` (empty string), `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, `false`  
- **Truthy values:** Pretty much everything else (non-empty strings, numbers other than `0`, objects, arrays, etc.)  

Knowing this makes your code more efficient and helps avoid weird bugs!  

### **3. Using `if`, `else if`, and `else`**  
Control structures let us decide what happens in a program.  

- **`if` statement:** Runs if a condition is `true`  
- **`else if` statement:** Checks another condition if the first one isn’t `true`  
- **`else` statement:** Runs as a last resort when nothing else is `true`  

This is the foundation of making interactive web apps.
